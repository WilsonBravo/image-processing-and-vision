//brief description
different solutions that propose to identify the direction of the light source in an image. The fact that there are three different modes is based on the need to achieve the most effective method possible. In the first mode, the light reflections by pixels in an image will be identified and an angle will be obtained corresponding to this, the second consists of identifying the concentrations of light in the different objects, and the third mode implements a filter to obtain only the concentrations. of light for a clearer location.
